# DS3500 - Advanced Programming with Data

Repository for work from DS3500 - Advanced Programming with Data

1. **Dashboards:**  
   The Stock Dashboard is a beginner-friendly tool designed to help users learn about stocks through an intuitive interface. Users start by selecting a company of their choice and choosing a date range for the stock graph, which displays historical data from 2019 onwards. Additionally, the dashboard features a recommendation graph, which provides insights based on various factors, offering users guidance on possible trade options. This project is ideal for individuals new to the stock market, providing them with foundational tools and visualizations to make informed decisions.

2. **Drake Equation:**  
   This project simulates the Drake Equation to estimate the number of extraterrestrial civilizations capable of interstellar communication. Using an enhanced Discrete Random Variable (DRV) model, it represents each factor of the equation through various distributions and calculates the expected value and standard deviation of possible outcomes. The final plot shows the probability distribution of N (the number of civilizations), illustrating the uncertainty inherent in these estimates.

3. **Evo_TA:**  
   The TA Lab Assignment Optimization project uses evolutionary computing to assign TAs to labs, minimizing overallocation, time conflicts, undersupport, and assignments TAs dislike. The model optimizes TA-lab matches based on preferences, availability, and course needs, helping ensure effective support for large classes.

4. **MCA:**  
   This project analyzes the diversity of artists in MCA Chicago's collection, using Sankey diagrams to show connections between nationality, birth decade, and gender. Key findings reveal a strong American and male artist representation, with fewer contemporary and non-binary artists. The project’s visualizations highlight areas for improved inclusivity in the art world.

5. **Natural Language:**  
   This project analyzes how Fox News, Al Jazeera, and Haaretz cover the Gaza conflict, comparing tone and word choice through text analysis. Articles on the same events were collected from each outlet, and visualizations like Sankey diagrams, word clouds, and bar charts were used to reveal word overlaps and patterns. Findings suggest Fox focuses on conflict with terms like “war” and “attack,” Haaretz emphasizes Israeli politics, and Al Jazeera ties Gaza events to regional geopolitics. Expanding the dataset could clarify any biases further.

6. **Predator-Prey Simulation:**  
   This project simulates an ecosystem with foxes (predators) and rabbits (prey). Rabbits graze and reproduce frequently, while foxes hunt rabbits and reproduce less often. The simulation uses customizable parameters for field size, grass growth, and initial populations, visualizing each species with unique colors. The model provides insights into population dynamics and ecosystem balance over time.
